Elliptic lift distribution CL curve: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/scoeu1xg4r
  Display the CL curve for an elliptic lift distribution on a tapered wing

Mohr Circle demonstrator: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/zcmm55srxh
  Visualizes the Mohr Circle, a mechanics of materials concept for analysis of stress states through stress transformations

Satellite movement: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ichwni7wfi
  Animates a satellite moving in a Newtonian gravity field around a point mass planet

Linear regressions: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/krxab9ldz5
Determines a best-fit linear model and displays of squared errors visually. Allows the user to "guess" the best fit, and then validates their guess

Function Growth: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/g9ff3oupu3
  Shows function growth over increasingly large inputs. Best for calculus 2 demonstration of function growth order

Simple harmonicm motion: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/lyz5p0jku2
  Tracess Lissajous curves from simple harmonic motion in a user-defineable area

Lissajous curve animator: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ekeriqp4gl
  Animates spinning Lissajous curves. This is pure eye candy

Lissajous curve resonance visualizer: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jvkhw0axll
  Creates curves from simple harmonic motion with a given resonsance ratio

Fourier series consturctor: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hop9rk3nzm
  Constructs a Fourier series of any function, showing the period function as well as the approximation and the sines that added up to produce that approximation

Solar Calculations: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/n9dxrxtvxm
  Calculates sunrise/sunset times with a complete UI. See C repository that accomplishes this much more efficiently and accurately, but in an admittedly less impressive way.

Solar Calculations + Visualization: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vmutgtuosc
  Similar to the above, but with more visual elements. It's also MUCH slower

Day Length Visualizer: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gpzy5peijq
  Yet another solar calculation tool, with more emphasis on trends than daily numbers

Collisions Feasibility Visualizer: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pafak9da7s
  Demostrates whether collisions with given conditions are possible
